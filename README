lojacc

lojacc is the client part of my project on creating a chatserver + client.
As a former IBM employee I really liked how pictures, smileys and "snapshots" worked in Sametime. As I'm also a bit of an IRC-fan, I would like to combine them a bit.

GOALS:
  Work on firefox/chrome/ie for linux/win7 with as little deviation as possible
  Some font attributes (bold text, at least 6 colors)
  Themeability
    Set custom font through GUI
    Set custom font color through GUI

BUGS:
  Scroll (Win7 Chrome/Firefox/IE10)

FEATURES:
  Blink on stuff
  Default Sametime smileys
  Custom Smileys

ChatClient:
v0.1 @ 2013-05-06
  Basic chat client, can send and receive with a GUI consisting of two5A windows
v0.1.1 @ 2013-05-08
  Changed top window, which now displays HTML (for now BOLD works)
v0.1.1b @ 2013-05-14
  Fixed bug that made machines not using UTF-8 to mess up the encoding
