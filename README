lojacc

lojacc is the client part of my project on creating a chatserver + client.
As a former IBM employee I really liked how pictures, smileys and "snapshots" worked in Sametime. As I'm also a bit of an IRC-fan, I would like to combine them a bit.

GOALS:
  Work on firefox/chrome/ie for linux/win7 with as little deviation as possible
  Some font attributes (bold text, at least 6 colors)
  Themeability
    Set custom font through GUI
    Set custom font color through GUI

BUGS:
  Scroll (Win7 Chrome/Firefox/IE10)

PLANNED FEATURES
  Blink on updates
  Default Sametime smileys
  Custom Smileys
