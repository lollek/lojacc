lojacc

lojacc is the client part of my project on creating a chatserver + client.
As a former IBM employee I really liked how pictures, smileys and "snapshots" worked in Sametime. As I'm also a bit of an IRC-fan, I would like to combine them a bit.

TO UPDATE:
  On received messages:
    Window header should update

  Smileys:
    Add a button for smileys
    Make it possible to drag-drop images to the chat window

  Scroll:
    It's possible to mess upp the scroll bar it seems..
    Maybe make it autoscroll to the bottom when there are new messages

  Spellcheck:
    If possible, add a swedish spellcheck

  Colors:
    Make own font color always be set to something, e.g. blue
    Make everyone in the chat automatically use 1 of maybe 6 colors.  

  General:
    Add copy-paste to right click?
    Not possible to copy-paste to/from chat

 Browser title bar updates:

 Added index.html, since it's become a part of the applet
 Also added a lib/java-plugin-1.6.0.23.jar since I need it to compile
  I've had some issues with IcedTea's plugin.jar, but it now seems like I can run the applet with it?
  I may remove this after some testing
